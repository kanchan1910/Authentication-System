# **_Authentication System_**

This project mainly focuses on learning the authentication when the user logs in.
 1. When user comes to the home page without logging in, then it will be re-directed to the login page.
 2. When user comes to the login page, then if the user enters the correct credentials then, it will be successfully logged in and gets re-directed to the home page but if the user enters the wrong credentials, then it will not be able to view the home page and will again be directed to that same login page.
 3. When user comes to the home page after successful login, then the home page is displayed to the user, along with the logout option,
 so that the user can logout if they want.
